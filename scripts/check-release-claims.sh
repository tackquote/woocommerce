# README/release contract — fails CI if a merchant-facing README regresses on
# either of the two defects that shipped in the retired hub's issue #20 (archived):
#
#   1. A version-pinned release asset URL (`releases/download/vX.Y.Z/...`).
#      These go stale the moment the next release ships. In the hub repo, which
#      cut one repo-wide `v*` tag covering every platform, the v1.1.0 links in
#      the pre-fix README kept returning 200 while serving a build four releases
#      out of date. This repository releases only this extension, but a pinned
#      link still goes stale on the very next tag. The only safe merchant-facing link is
#      `releases/latest/download/<exact-asset-name>`.
#
#   2. Fabricated API surface. `/v1/webhooks` and `/v1/widget/quotes` do not
#      exist anywhere in this repository's connector code — they were invented
#      for a "Tack triggers webhook events to create official orders/invoices"
#      claim that was false for every platform this repo ships (see the
#      per-platform READMEs: WooCommerce/PrestaShop/Shopware push orders OUT,
#      one direction only; OpenCart/Zen Cart expose a real inbound
#      order-creation route, but it is `order.add` / `POST /orders`, not a
#      generic webhook; Magento's is its own core Admin REST API). If either
#      string reappears in a README, someone is re-describing an endpoint that
#      was never real instead of citing the platform-specific one.
#
# Copied from the hub repository (tackquote/tack-ecommerce-extensions, retired 2026-10-04)
# when this extension moved to its own repository; it scans this repository root.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-release-claims.sh [file ...]   (default: every README*.md)
