/**
 * B2B pricing resolved by TackQuote, applied to the WooCommerce storefront.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS CLOSES
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Until now the plugin could SEND a quote request and RECEIVE Tack-resolved
 * prices back on the quote — but a signed-in trade customer browsing the shop
 * still saw the store's retail price, because nothing let the storefront ask
 * what Tack would charge before a quote existed. The wholesale price only
 * appeared after the fact.
 *
 * `POST /storefront-pricing/resolve` is the answer to that question. It takes a
 * buyer email and a set of SKUs and returns the price Tack's own price books,
 * buyer groups and quantity breaks resolve to — the same authority that prices
 * a quote. This class asks it, and applies the answer.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS CHARGED, AND WHAT IS SHOWN, ARE TWO DIFFERENT HOOKS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * See `init()` for the full argument. In short: the cart is priced on
 * `woocommerce_before_calculate_totals`, because that is the only hook that
 * knows how many of each line the buyer actually ordered — and without a
 * quantity a quantity BREAK cannot exist. The label is a separate filter on
 * `woocommerce_get_price_html`.
 *
 * Money is involved either way, so three rules keep it honest, and each one is
 * a test in tests/wholesale-pricing-test.php:
 *
 *   1. NO ANSWER MEANS NO CHANGE. A network failure, a timeout, an unknown SKU
 *      or a `null` unitPrice all leave the store's own price untouched. The
 *      failure mode is "wholesale pricing did not apply", never "the product is
 *      free" — `0` is a legitimate resolved price and `null` is not, so the two
 *      are distinguished explicitly rather than through PHP's falsy rules.
 *   2. ANONYMOUS SHOPPERS ARE NEVER PRICED. Without a signed-in customer there
 *      is no buyer to resolve against, so no request is made at all. This also
 *      means a page cache holding a logged-out render can never contain one
 *      customer's negotiated price.
 *   3. ONE REQUEST PER PAGE, NOT ONE PER PRODUCT. A shop page renders dozens of
 *      products and each one calls `get_price()` several times. Every lookup is
 *      served from a request-scoped map, and the map is filled by a single
 *      batched call. Without this a category page would issue ~100 HTTP
 *      requests and time out.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * GATING
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * B2B pricing is a paid TackQuote capability. That is NOT enforced here — a
 * client-side plan check is a client-side plan check. The endpoint sits behind
 * `ApiKeyGuard` and `PlanGuard` on the API, so a store on a plan without it
 * receives an error and, by rule 1 above, simply keeps its own prices. What
 * this class does is avoid asking when there is obviously nothing to ask with:
 * no API key, or no signed-in customer.

	 * ── Two hooks, deliberately, rather than one ──────────────────────────────
	 *
	 * The obvious implementation is a single filter on
	 * `woocommerce_product_get_price`, and the first version of this class did
	 * exactly that. It is wrong twice over:
	 *
	 *   · THAT FILTER HAS NO QUANTITY. It is asked "what does this product
	 *     cost", not "what do 100 of them cost", so a quantity break can never
	 *     be applied through it — it always resolves at quantity 1. The volume
	 *     table would advertise "100+ £55.00" and the cart would charge £61.50.
	 *     Displaying a discount the checkout does not honour is worse than not
	 *     offering one.
	 *   · IT FIRES EVERYWHERE. Every product read, in admin, REST, cron, emails
	 *     and reports, several times per product per page.
	 *
	 * So the work is split the way WooCommerce intends, and the way the mature
	 * B2B plugins do it:
	 *
	 *   DISPLAY -> `woocommerce_get_price_html`, which is only about the label.
	 *   MONEY   -> `woocommerce_before_calculate_totals`, which is the one place
	 *              that knows the real quantity of each line, and where
	 *              `$item['data']->set_price()` is the documented way to price a
	 *              cart line dynamically.
