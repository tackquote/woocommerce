/**
 * Payment and shipping methods restricted by TackQuote buyer group.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Net 30 is for approved trade accounts only." Every B2B store needs some
 * version of that, and WooCommerce has no concept of one: a gateway is either
 * enabled for everybody or nobody. Retail shoppers therefore see an invoice
 * option they cannot use, and the seller finds out when an unapproved buyer
 * places a 30-day order.
 *
 * TackQuote already knows which group a buyer belongs to — the badge added in
 * 1.7.0 asks for exactly that — so the group is the natural thing to gate on.
 * No new lookup is introduced here; this reuses `Tack_B2B_Notices::buyer_group()`
 * and the answer it has already cached for the request.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THE RULE IS "ALLOW-LIST, AND EMPTY MEANS UNRESTRICTED"
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Each restricted method names the groups that MAY use it. A method with no
 * groups named is left alone entirely.
 *
 * That default matters more than it looks. The alternative — "a method with no
 * groups is available to nobody" — turns activating this feature into an
 * immediate checkout outage, because every method starts unconfigured. A
 * merchant would switch it on, lose every payment option, and have no idea
 * why. So configuring nothing changes nothing.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * AND WHY IT FAILS OPEN
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * If TackQuote cannot be reached the buyer's group is unknown. Hiding every
 * restricted method in that case would mean a slow API removes the customer's
 * ability to pay. The unknown-group case therefore leaves the methods visible,
 * for the same reason order limits do not block on a timeout: an over-permissive
 * checkout costs a conversation, an unavailable one costs the day.
 *
 * A merchant who genuinely needs the strict reading can invert it with the
 * `tackquote_restrict_when_group_unknown` filter.
