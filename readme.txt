Request a quote from WooCommerce for B2B wholesale quoting — sync orders to your TackQuote account with one API key.

== Description ==

**TackQuote for WooCommerce** adds request-a-quote buttons to your products, so B2B and wholesale shoppers can ask for a price instead of checking out — and optionally syncs orders one-way to your TackQuote account.

[Learn more about the WooCommerce integration](https://tackquote.com/integrations/woocommerce) &middot; [Create a free TackQuote account](https://app.tackquote.com/register)

= What you get =

* **Add to Quote** and **Request a Quote** buttons on product pages. Show either, both, or neither.
* A floating **quote list** with **Checkout as Quote** — several products, one request. It is separate from the WooCommerce cart, so stock and checkout are untouched.
* **Quote only (B2B catalogue) mode** — switch Add to Cart off across the whole store and take quotes instead. Your products, categories and search keep working; only checkout goes away. Apply it to everyone, to signed-out visitors only, or to chosen roles.
* Optional one-way **order sync** to TackQuote — off by default, and queued through Action Scheduler so it never runs inside checkout.
* Works with WooCommerce **High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS)**.

Setup is one field: paste your TackQuote API key. You can [create an account here](https://app.tackquote.com/register).

= What it does not do =

* It does not replace WooCommerce checkout or act as a full CPQ workspace.
* Order sync is **outbound only** — it does not import quotes as orders, sync your catalogue, or touch inventory.
* Failed syncs are logged (WooCommerce → Status → Logs, source `tackquote`) and never block checkout.

Source code is developed in the open at [github.com/ackm04/tack-ecommerce-extensions](https://github.com/ackm04/tack-ecommerce-extensions).

== External services ==

This plugin connects to the TackQuote API, a third-party B2B quoting service operated by
TackQuote, to send quote requests that shoppers submit on your store and — only if you
switch it on — to send data about orders placed in your store.

The service is required for the plugin to work. Without a TackQuote account and API key the
plugin cannot create quotes, and its storefront buttons do nothing. Nothing is sent anywhere
until you enter an API key.

All requests go to the API base URL set under **TackQuote → TackQuote API URL**, which is
`https://api.tackquote.com/v1` unless your TackQuote support contact gave you a different
one. Every request carries your TackQuote API key so the service can identify your account.

1. **Connection test** — `GET /integrations/woocommerce/ping`, falling back to `GET /health`.
Sent when an administrator clicks "Test TackQuote connection" on the plugin settings screen.
Sends your API key only: no store, order or customer data.

2. **Quote form field policy** — `GET /integrations/woocommerce/registration-config`.
Sent when a storefront page showing a quote button is viewed and the cached policy has
expired (cached for 15 minutes). Sends your API key only: no store, order or customer data.

3. **Quote request** — `POST /integrations/woocommerce/quote-requests`.
Sent when a shopper submits the quote form on your storefront. Sends what that shopper typed
into the form, plus the products being quoted: email address, first and last name, phone
number if given, company name and any company details the seller's registration policy
requires (legal name, tax/VAT ID, registration number, website, address, city, state, postal
code, country, company phone, industry, employee count), the free-text note if written, and
for each requested product its name, SKU, quantity, unit price excluding tax and WooCommerce
product ID, together with the store's currency code.

4. **Order sync** — `POST /integrations/woocommerce/order-sync`. **Off by default.**
Sent when an order is created and each time its status changes, but only if the merchant has
switched on "Sync orders to TackQuote". Sends the whole order: the customer's billing and
shipping addresses, email address and phone numbers, WooCommerce customer ID, their order
note, the order ID, number and status, currency and totals, coupon codes, timestamps, the
payment method ID and title, the payment gateway's transaction ID, and every line item with
its name, SKU, product and variation IDs, quantities, totals, taxes and item meta. No card
numbers, no card details and no gateway credentials are ever sent. The **Privacy** section
below lists every field individually.

This plugin sends data to no other external service.

The TackQuote service is provided by TackQuote. By using this plugin you agree to their
terms. Please review them before entering an API key:

* Terms of Service: https://tackquote.com/terms
* Privacy Policy: https://tackquote.com/privacy

== Installation ==

WooCommerce must be installed and active first, and you need a TackQuote account —
[create one here](https://app.tackquote.com/register) if you do not have one yet.

= Install =

1. In WP Admin go to **Plugins → Add New**, search for **TackQuote for WooCommerce**, and click **Install Now**.
2. Activate **TackQuote for WooCommerce**.
3. Open **TackQuote** in the admin menu.
4. Paste your **TackQuote API Key** (TackQuote → Settings → Developer → API Keys). Leave the API URL as the default unless support gives you another base URL.
5. Enable or disable the quote buttons and order sync as needed, then click **Save TackQuote settings**.
6. Click **Test TackQuote connection** to verify.

Before you enter an API key, read the **External services** section above: the plugin cannot
create quotes without sending data to the TackQuote API.

= Manual install =

1. Download `tackquote.zip` from [the releases page](https://github.com/ackm04/tack-ecommerce-extensions/releases), or build it from source with `bash bin/build.sh`.
2. In WP Admin go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**, upload the ZIP, and choose **Replace current with uploaded** if an older copy is already installed.
3. Activate, then follow steps 3–6 above.
4. Your API key and toggles are stored as WordPress options and are preserved across updates.

== Privacy ==

This plugin sends data to TackQuote, a third-party service, over HTTPS. It sends nothing anywhere else, and it never sends payment card data.

= Where data is sent =

To the TackQuote API base URL configured under **TackQuote → TackQuote API URL** — `https://api.tackquote.com/v1` unless your TackQuote support contact gave you another one. Endpoints used:

* `GET /integrations/woocommerce/ping` (and `GET /health`) — connection test. Sends no store or customer data.
* `GET /integrations/woocommerce/registration-config` — fetches which fields the quote form should ask for. Sends no store or customer data.
* `POST /integrations/woocommerce/quote-requests` — a shopper's quote request.
* `POST /integrations/woocommerce/order-sync` — order sync. **Only when the merchant has switched order sync on. It is off by default.**

= What a quote request sends =

Sent when a shopper submits the quote form, using only what they typed into it:

* Email address
* First name, last name
* Phone number (if provided)
* Company name, and any company fields the seller's registration policy requires (for example legal name, tax/VAT ID, registration number, address, city, state, postal code, country, company phone, industry, employee count)
* The free-text note, if written (capped at 2,000 characters)
* The requested products: name, SKU, quantity, unit price excluding tax, and the WooCommerce product ID
* The store's currency code

= What order sync sends (off by default) =

Sent for each order when it is created and when its status changes, if the merchant
has enabled **Sync orders to TackQuote**. This is the whole order, because a quote
that becomes an order is only useful to the seller if it carries who is buying and
where it is going. Read this list before switching order sync on.

**The customer's identity and addresses**

* Billing address in full: first name, last name, company, street (both lines), city, state or county, postal code, country, email address and phone number
* Shipping address in full: the same fields, including shipping phone where WooCommerce holds one
* The WooCommerce customer ID, or `0` for a guest order
* The customer's order note, as they wrote it

**The order**

* WooCommerce order ID, order number and status
* Currency, item subtotal, discount total, shipping total, tax total and order total
* Coupon codes applied
* A purchase-order number, only if your store fills the `tack_quotes_order_po_number` filter — WooCommerce core has no purchase-order field, so nothing is sent unless you wire one up
* Created, last-modified, paid and completed timestamps
* An idempotency key, so a repeated delivery of the same order state can be discarded

**Payment**

* Payment method ID and its display title (for example `stripe` / "Credit Card")
* The gateway transaction ID, where the gateway recorded one
* Whether the order still needs payment, and when it was paid

**No card numbers, no card details, and no gateway credentials are ever sent.** The
transaction ID is a reference the gateway issued, not an instrument.

**Line items**

* Product name, SKU, WooCommerce product ID and variation ID
* Quantity, line subtotal, line total and line tax
* Item meta — the variation attributes and any custom item fields your store records on a line (for example "Size: Large", "Colour: Blue"). If your checkout writes customer-supplied text onto a line item, it is included here
* Shipping lines: method title and cost. Fee lines: name and amount

= If you are a merchant in the EU, UK or another jurisdiction with a transfer regime =

Order sync sends personal data about your customers to TackQuote, which makes
TackQuote a processor acting on your instructions. That is why it ships switched
**off** and why enabling it is a deliberate act rather than a default. Before you
enable it, satisfy yourself that you have a lawful basis and, where required, a data
processing agreement in place with TackQuote. Your own privacy policy should name
TackQuote as a recipient; the plugin adds suggested wording to
**Settings → Privacy** for you to review and adapt.

= What is stored on your own site =

* Plugin settings, as WordPress options: the TackQuote API key, API URL, button labels, and the feature toggles.
* `tack_quotes_registration_config` — a transient caching the quote-form field policy for 15 minutes.
* `tack_qr_*` — short-lived transients counting quote requests per visitor for rate limiting. They hold a salted hash of the visitor's IP address, never the address itself, and expire after 5 minutes.
* `_tack_quotes_sync_key` — order meta recording which order state was last accepted by TackQuote, so the same state is not sent twice.

Deleting the plugin removes every option above and the `tack_quotes_registration_config` transient, on every site of a multisite network. The `tack_qr_*` rate-limit counters are left to expire on their own (they last five minutes and are keyed on a hash, so there is no name to delete). The `_tack_quotes_sync_key` order meta is deliberately left in place: orders are financial records and an uninstall routine should not rewrite every one of them.

= Suggested privacy policy text =

The plugin adds suggested wording to **Settings → Privacy → Policy guide** in WordPress, listing the same fields. Edit it to match how your store actually uses the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get an API key? =

In TackQuote, go to **Settings → Developer → API Keys**.

= Does it work with High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS)? =

Yes. The plugin declares HPOS (`custom_order_tables`) compatibility via WooCommerce `FeaturesUtil` and uses the WooCommerce order CRUD APIs (`wc_get_order`, order status hooks) rather than direct `wp_posts` order queries. You can run with HPOS enabled.

= Is order sync bidirectional? =

No. Sync is one-way: WooCommerce → TackQuote on order create and status change. Turning the toggle off stops new pushes; it does not delete data already in TackQuote.

= My store collects a purchase-order number at checkout. Can it be synced? =

Yes, with one line of code. WooCommerce core has no purchase-order field, and there is no
meta key this plugin could guess that would be right for every B2B extension — a guess that
looks correct and silently returns nothing is worse than an empty field. So the value is
read through a filter your theme or a small site plugin fills in:

`add_filter( 'tack_quotes_order_po_number', function ( $po, $order ) { return $order->get_meta( '_my_checkout_po_field' ); }, 10, 2 );`

Replace `_my_checkout_po_field` with the meta key your checkout writes. Without this filter
nothing is sent and TackQuote records no purchase-order number.

= Do the quote buttons replace checkout, or touch the WooCommerce cart? =

No, and no. "Add to Quote" adds the product to a separate, browser-side quote list — it never touches the WooCommerce cart, stock, or totals. "Checkout as Quote" creates a quote request in TackQuote from that list's contents. Customers can still shop and check out through WooCommerce completely normally, at the same time, with no interaction between the two.

= Why doesn't "Add to Quote" send a quote request immediately? =

So shoppers can add multiple products before requesting one combined quote. Use the floating "Quote list" button (bottom-right) once you've added everything you want quoted, then click "Checkout as Quote".

== Screenshots ==

1. Quote buttons sit beside Add to Cart on the product page, so a shopper can buy or ask for a price without leaving the page.
2. The quote list collects several products, then sends them to TackQuote as one request.
3. Store mode in the plugin settings: run a normal shop that also takes quotes, or switch the whole store to a B2B catalogue.
4. Quote-only mode on the storefront. Add to Cart is withdrawn and the quote buttons remain, so the catalogue still works and only checkout goes away.

== Changelog ==

= 1.7.1 =
* **Security.** A customer could inherit another buyer's pricing group — and through it their payment terms — by changing their own email address. WooCommerce lets a customer change it on My Account with no verification: the current password is required only when the PASSWORD changes. Its one protection, `email_exists()`, refuses only an address already held by another WordPress user — so a TackQuote buyer approved for Net-30 who never registered on the store was takeable. A self-changed address is now untrusted until re-confirmed; the account still works normally, it is simply treated as anonymous by TackQuote. Stores that verify email another way can opt back in with `tackquote_trust_unverified_email`.
* **Security.** "TackQuote could not be reached" and "TackQuote says this buyer is in no group" were the same answer internally, and both fell through to the permissive default — so a buyer definitively placed in NO group was handed every group-restricted payment method. They are now distinguished: a real answer refuses a restricted method, and only a genuine outage leaves it visible.
* Group codes are matched case-insensitively.
* The payment/shipping rule fields now list the store's real gateway ids, since WooCommerce → Settings → Payments shows titles rather than the ids the field needs.

= 1.7.0 =
* New: **order limits**. TackQuote already held minimum/maximum order quantities and enforced them when a quote was converted, but a WooCommerce shopper never saw them — they filled a cart, reached checkout, and the order was refused. The limit is now shown on the product page AND enforced on the cart and at checkout.
* New: **buyer group badge**. Shows a signed-in customer which pricing group they are on. Without it a discounted price appears with no explanation, which reads as a pricing error rather than the negotiated rate it is.
* A TackQuote outage never blocks checkout. Nothing is refused unless TackQuote actually answered with a limit — a checkout that stops working because a supplier's API is slow costs the day's revenue, while an unenforced minimum costs a phone call.
* Quantities are summed across cart lines of the same product before checking, so 10 + 20 satisfies a minimum of 25.
* Both switches are off by default, under **WooCommerce → TackQuote → B2B pricing**.

= 1.6.0 =
* New: **B2B pricing**. A signed-in trade customer can now be priced from their TackQuote price book, buyer group and quantity breaks — the same pricing authority that prices a quote. Until now the plugin could send a quote request and receive Tack-resolved prices back on the quote, but a customer browsing the shop still saw the retail price, because nothing let the storefront ASK what Tack would charge before a quote existed.
* New: an optional **Volume pricing** table on product pages, showing only the tiers that actually change the price for that customer. It renders nothing when there is one tier, rather than showing an empty table under a heading.
* Quantity breaks apply to the CART, at the quantity actually ordered — not just to the table. The price is set on `woocommerce_before_calculate_totals`, which is the only hook that knows how many of each line the buyer wants; a filter on `woocommerce_product_get_price` has no quantity at all, so it could only ever resolve at one unit and would have advertised a volume discount the checkout did not honour.
* Both are **off by default** and must be switched on under **WooCommerce → TackQuote → B2B pricing**. B2B pricing changes the price used at CHECKOUT, not just the price displayed, so it is opted into rather than inherited from a plugin update.
* Correct on tax-inclusive stores. TackQuote returns a NET unit price, while `set_price()` means "the price in the basis this store is configured for". On a store set to enter prices inclusive of tax, the net figure is grossed up using the product's own tax class first — without that, WooCommerce would extract the tax back out of it and the seller would absorb the VAT on every wholesale line (a £100 net line at 20% would charge £100 instead of £120).
* Safety: if TackQuote cannot be reached, returns no price for a SKU, or your plan does not include B2B pricing, your store keeps its own prices. No product is ever left unpriced or silently zeroed — a resolved price of `0` is honoured as a real price, while "no answer" is not.
* Anonymous shoppers are never priced and no request is made for them, so a page cache holding a logged-out render can never contain one customer's negotiated price.
* One batched request per page rather than one per product: a category page resolves up to 50 SKUs in a single call.

= 1.5.1 =
* Shortened the description and added links to the WooCommerce integration page and to account signup, so it is clear where to get an API key.
* No code changes.

= 1.5.0 =
* Order sync now sends the whole order, not eleven fields of it. Previously the payload carried no address of any kind — a merchant testing it in production reported "no name, not address information, nothing", and they were right. It now carries both addresses in full, phone numbers, the WooCommerce customer ID and order note, the real item subtotal alongside discount/shipping/tax/total, coupon codes, payment method and gateway transaction reference, the created/modified/paid/completed timestamps, shipping and fee lines, and per-line product/variation IDs, line subtotal, tax and item meta (so "Large / Blue" survives the sync).
* Fixed: `subtotal` was never sent, so the receiving end recorded `subtotal = total` — meaning every order from a store that charges tax or shipping claimed its goods cost what the customer paid.
* New: `tack_quotes_order_po_number` filter. WooCommerce core has no purchase-order field, so nothing is sent unless your store wires one up; see the FAQ. Previously a purchase-order number could never be reported at all.
* Fixed: `modifiedAt` is sent but deliberately excluded from the idempotency hash. Under HPOS, recording a successful push writes order meta, and that stamps a new modified date — so hashing it would have invalidated the key the push just recorded and de-duplication would never have converged.
* The privacy disclosure on the settings screen, the wording offered to **Settings → Privacy**, and the **External services** and **Privacy** sections of this readme now describe the payload that is actually sent. An under-disclosure is worse than none: a merchant reads it and concludes the transfer is narrower than it is.
* Fixed: the settings screen named the WooCommerce log source as `tack-quotes`; it has been `tackquote` since the 1.3.3 slug rename.
* Added `tests/test-order-payload.php`, a WP-CLI contract test that names every required payload field against a real WooCommerce order, and offline payload coverage in `tests/run.php`.
* Tests: the quote-only mode suite now asserts that `woocommerce_is_purchasable` is actually hooked, not just that the callback decides correctly. It previously proved only the latter, so a wiring mistake would have hidden the buttons while the Store API kept taking orders. No behaviour change — the wiring was already correct.

= 1.4.0 =
* New: **Store mode**. A single setting turns the whole storefront into a B2B catalogue — "Add to cart" is withdrawn and customers request a quote instead. Choose whether it applies to every customer, to signed-out visitors only (so approved trade customers keep a normal cart), or to specific roles. Optionally replace prices with "Price on request".
* The switch is enforced server-side via `woocommerce_is_purchasable`, which WooCommerce checks before accepting any cart line — so a hand-crafted `?add-to-cart=` link, the Store API and cached pages are all refused, not just the button hidden.
* Carts filled *before* the store was switched to quote-only are emptied on the cart and checkout pages with an explanatory notice. WooCommerce's own cart validation only checks that a product still exists, not that it is purchasable, so without this a pre-existing cart could still be checked out and the store would not really be quote-only.
* Anyone who can manage WooCommerce keeps a working cart, so you can test your own store while it is closed to customers.
* Quote buttons now also mount outside the add-to-cart form, so they survive when the cart button is withdrawn.

= 1.3.4 =
* Fixed: the **Settings** link on the Plugins screen led to "Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page." even for an administrator. The link carried a hardcoded `page=tack-quotes`, which was the admin page slug up to 1.3.1; the 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 renames moved the slug to `tackquote` and left the link behind. Pointing at an unregistered page makes WordPress emit its permission-denied message, so the failure looked like a capability problem and was not one. The link is now derived from the same constant the menu is registered with, so the two cannot drift again.
* Added a regression test (`tests/run.php`, no PHPUnit or WordPress install required) asserting the Settings link resolves to a registered admin page that requires `manage_options`.

= 1.3.3 =
* The plugin slug, text domain, plugin folder and distributed ZIP are now all `tackquote`, matching the slug assigned on WordPress.org. WordPress requires the text domain to equal the slug, and a plugin folder that disagrees with either is its own defect. The admin page, the enqueued script/style handles, the Action Scheduler group and the WooCommerce log source move with it, so the log source is now `tackquote`.
* readme.txt now carries an **External services** section disclosing the TackQuote API: that the plugin cannot function without it, that nothing is sent until an API key is entered, and, endpoint by endpoint, what is sent and when — with links to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
* Fixed the download links, which pointed at a repository that does not exist. The source now lives at https://github.com/ackm04/tack-ecommerce-extensions.
* Note for anyone updating a manually installed 1.3.2: the folder changed from `tackquote-for-woocommerce/` to `tackquote/`, so WordPress treats the new ZIP as a separate plugin. Deactivate and delete the old copy after installing this one. Your API key and toggles are stored as WordPress options and survive both.

= 1.3.2 =
* Packaging: the distributed ZIP now unpacks to `tackquote-for-woocommerce/`, matching the plugin slug, and is rebuilt from the current source. The previously published download still contained pre-1.2.0 code, so stores installing it got the old buttons and none of the 1.3.1 security fixes.
* No functional changes to the plugin itself beyond the version bump.

= 1.3.1 =
* Security: company field names supplied by the API are now escaped and allowlisted before being rendered into the quote form, closing a cross-site scripting hole.
* Security: the TackQuote API key is no longer rendered into the settings page HTML. Leave the field blank to keep the saved key; a new "Remove saved API key" button clears it.
* Security: the settings page now requires the administrator capability, which is also the capability WordPress requires to save it — a shop manager previously saw the page but could not save it.
* Quote requests from the storefront are rate limited per visitor, the note field is length-capped, and the request timeout is 5s instead of 20s.
* Order sync is now queued and sent on a background request through Action Scheduler, so it no longer runs inside checkout, and each push carries an idempotency key so the same order state is never sent twice.
* Order sync now defaults to OFF on new installs, and readme.txt documents exactly which fields are sent where. Existing stores keep their current setting.
* An expired or cache-stale security token now says so and offers a reload, instead of showing a generic error that could never be resolved.
* Quantity and variation are read from the clicked product's own form, fixing wrong values on grouped products, product archives, related-product rows and sticky add-to-cart bars.
* Declares compatibility with the Cart and Checkout blocks, and adds the `WC tested up to` header that WooCommerce needs before it will surface any compatibility declaration.
* Uninstall now removes every option and transient the plugin creates.

= 1.3.0 =
* "Add to Quote" no longer adds the product to the WooCommerce cart. It now adds to a separate, browser-side "quote list" that never touches stock, cart totals, or checkout. A floating "Quote list" button (bottom-right, site-wide) appears once at least one product is added, showing what's in it and a "Checkout as Quote" button that submits the whole list as one TackQuote request. The WooCommerce cart page no longer has a quote button — quoting and purchasing are now fully separate paths.

= 1.2.0 =
* Restored "Request a Quote" as an independent, configurable product-page button alongside "Add to Quote" — Settings → TackQuote now has checkboxes to show "Add to Quote", "Request a Quote", both, or neither on product pages (the cart page's "Checkout as Quote" is unaffected). Both default to on for existing and new installs.

= 1.1.0 =
* Split the single "Request a Quote" button into two: "Add to Quote" on product pages (adds the product to the cart, same as Add to Cart) and "Checkout as Quote" on the cart page (submits everything in the cart as one quote request). Previously the product-page button submitted a quote for that one product immediately, with no way to accumulate multiple products into a single request without using the whole-cart button on every add.

= 1.0.1 =
* Replaced the browser `prompt()`/`alert()` quote-request flow with a real modal dialog (email + optional note fields, inline validation, loading/success/error states). Email is pre-filled for logged-in customers.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release: Request a Quote button, one-way order sync, TackQuote settings, HPOS declaration.
